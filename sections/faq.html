            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>When is the deadline for filing annual tax returns in Nigeria?</summary>
                <p>For individuals, personal income tax returns are due by March 31st of each year. For companies, returns are due within 6 months of the company's year-end. We help you track these deadlines so you never miss them.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What documents do I need to register an LLC?</summary>
                <p>You'll need valid means of identification for all directors/shareholders, passport photographs, proof of address, and your proposed company name. We'll guide you through the exact requirements based on your specific situation.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>How long does LLC registration take?</summary>
                <p>Typically, the CAC registration process takes 7-14 business days once all documents are submitted. Name reservation takes 1-2 days. We'll keep you updated at every stage.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What's the difference between an LLC and a Business Name?</summary>
                <p>An LLC (Limited Liability Company) is a separate legal entity that protects your personal assets from business liabilities. A Business Name is simply a trading name registered to you as an individual—your personal assets remain at risk. We recommend LLCs for most businesses.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Do I need to file taxes if my business made no profit?</summary>
                <p>It depends on your company size. Under the Nigeria Tax Act 2025, small companies with gross turnover not exceeding ₦50 million are exempt from Company Income Tax. However, larger companies must still file returns even with no profit. We'll assess your situation and ensure you're compliant.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Can you help with tax clearance certificates?</summary>
                <p>Absolutely. We assist with obtaining Tax Clearance Certificates (TCC) which are required for government contracts, bank loans, and various business transactions.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What are the penalties for late tax filing?</summary>
                <p>Late filing incurs a penalty of 10% of the tax due plus 21% interest per annum on any outstanding amount. Additionally, failure to file can result in fines of ₦25,000 for the first month and ₦5,000 for each subsequent month. Companies must also keep records for at least 6 years—failure to do so can attract fines up to ₦500,000. We help you stay compliant and avoid these penalties.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Do you work with businesses outside Lagos?</summary>
                <p>Yes! We serve clients across Nigeria. Most of our processes are handled digitally, so location is not a barrier. Simply reach out via WhatsApp or email to get started.</p>
            </details>
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Does my business need to register for VAT?</summary>
                <p>If your business has an annual turnover of ₦25 million or more, you must register for VAT. The current VAT rate is 7.5% on goods and services. VAT-registered businesses must file monthly returns and will need to adopt e-invoicing systems. We can help you with VAT registration and ongoing compliance.</p>
