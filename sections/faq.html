                <summary>What's the difference between an LLC and a Business Name?</summary>
                <p>An LLC (Limited Liability Company) is a separate legal entity that protects your personal assets from business liabilities. A Business Name is simply a trading name registered to you as an individual—your personal assets remain at risk. We recommend LLCs for most businesses.</p>

However, larger companies must still file returns even with no profit. We'll assess your situation and ensure you're compliant.</p>
