                <summary>What's the difference between an LLC and a Business Name?</summary>
                <p>An LLC (Limited Liability Company) is a separate legal entity that protects your personal assets from business liabilities. A Business Name is simply a trading name registered to you as an individual—your personal assets remain at risk. We recommend LLCs for most businesses.</p>

                <summary>Do I need to file taxes if my business made no profit?</summary>
                <p>Yes. In Nigeria, you must file tax returns regardless of profit. Filing "nil" returns keeps you compliant and avoids penalties. We can handle this for you quickly and affordably.</p>
